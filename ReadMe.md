# Description

This repository contains scripts and code for four tasks:  
1. Download 50 public profile PDFs of your connections (randomly) from LinkedIn.  
2. Extract text from the above PDFs and store them in a CSV.  
3. For every profile data (text), find out the most frequent words and essential words used. It
shouldnâ€™t contain stop words (like is, the, an, etc.).  
4. Create two web APIs using flask/Django or another framework of your choice.
    * The first web API should take a PDF file as input and return the text in it in JSON
    format.  
    * The second web API should take text data as input and return the most frequent
    words and important words (as mentioned in 3) in JSON format.
